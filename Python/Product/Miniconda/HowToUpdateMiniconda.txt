Install 64-bit miniconda to default location:
C:\ProgramData\Miniconda3

Copy the contents of that folder to a temporary folder.

Delete the contents of the pkgs folder, but keep the empty folder with a placeholder.txt that ensures the folder gets created. As the user install conda packages, they will get cached in the user's local app data folder.

Create a condarc file in temporary folder:

# directories in which environments are located
envs_dirs:
  - ~/.conda/envs

Delete the contents of Miniconda3-x64, and replace with the contents of temporary folder.
